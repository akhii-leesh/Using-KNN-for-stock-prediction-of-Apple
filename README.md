# Using-KNN-for-stock-prediction-of-Apple

Using the concept of K-nearest neighbours, I have classified the possibility to invest into Apple stocks in the forseeable future based on its historical prices.

About the dataset:
Date - Date of stock price recorded
Open - Stock price in the beginning of the market hours
Close - Stock price at the end of the market hours
High - Highest price recorded in the day
Low - Lowest price recorded in the day
